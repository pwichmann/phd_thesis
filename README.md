# Towards automatically generating supply chain maps from natural language text

## About 

This repository contains **supplementary material** for my PhD thesis "Towards automatically generating supply chain maps from natural language text".
This repository shall also provide pointers to the academic papers that have been written as part of this project.

## Content

The material contains the following:

* Distinction between supply chain and related concepts
* Supply chain resilience
* A critical reflection on the value of supply chain maps
* Inter- and intra-annotator agreement
* Use cases of structural supply chain visibility

## Publications

The following publications resulted from the research conducted as part of the PhD.
